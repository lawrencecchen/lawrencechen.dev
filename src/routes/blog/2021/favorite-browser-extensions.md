## [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)

Does anyone seriously like ads?

## [Bitwarden](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb)

Why use this instead of the browser’s built in password manager? Portability. It’s also open source (hopefully community audited) and free for personal use!

## [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp)

Goodbye Google, doubleclick, Disqus widgets, recaptcha, and all those other things I don’t want in my life.

## [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en)

`j` to scroll down, `k` to scroll up. `f` to navigate links (without a cursor). `gg` to scroll to the top. `yt` to duplicate your current tab.

## [SponsorBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone?hl=en)

Say no to Squarespace, Skillshare, NordVPN, Audible, Brilliant, Honey, CuriosityStream, etc. Skip your favorite content creators when they shill. Don’t worry, they’ll (hopefully) still get paid!

## [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)

In case you don’t use Firefox. Make debugging APIs that much prettier.

## [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en)

Goodbye pages that think people want absurdly large headers.

## [ScrollAnywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrollanywhere/jehmdpemhgfgjblpkilmeoafmkhbckhi)

If you have a mouse with a physical, clicky scroll wheel...
