This blog was built on [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) with icons from [Heroicons](http://heroicons.com/) and [Feathericons](https://feathericons.com/).

The design language is heavily inspired by [Vercel's](https://vercel.com/design). Several components' markup were copied directly from [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/).
