*An unedited in-class essay from AP Literature, 2021.*

In Tim O’Brien ‘s novel _The Things They Carried,_ the most illuminating moment is during a brief episode before his enlistment when he fled to the Canadian border. The solitude and the companionship of the old Elroy Berdahl forces the narrator’s deep reflection of his morality, revealing that truth is never binary and it often becomes warped when people try force a singular notion of the truth.

After receiving notice that he was drafted for the war, Tim O’Brien recalls being left in a stupor. Soon, his denial was replaced with resentment as he confronts and scorns society’s version of the “truth.” Inside his mind, he was “detest[ing] the blind, thoughtless, automatic acquiescence” to the war that was a consequence of “simpleminded patriotism” and “prideful ignorance.” After all, “it was a war to stop the Communists.” While his scorn of the unnuanced masses’ is warranted, it is motivated not out of moral superiority but out of fear. This was not immediately

apparent to himself due to shock, evident in his reflex to blame his situation on the external factors around him. Moreover, his sentiment is not particularly out of the ordinary – during the during the 1960s, the United States had already gone through decades of the Great Scare and accompanying McCarthyism. Likewise, there were many areas of public opinion that detested the war, harkening the situation in Vietnam as natives seeking independence from the imperial France. Regardless, the other “truth” – that was apparent in O’Brien “conservative [hometown]…a place where tradition counted” – is not any less true than the sentiments of the anti-war. People’s love for their family, their reputation , and their familiar and defined roles in their communities justifiably obscured peoples’ ability to see the pointlessness of the war, and the accompanying pride of the people around him trapped O’Brien into holding in his outburst. O’Brien even considered this ever-present fear “of embarrassment” more powerful than the fear for his life during his time in Vietnam. O’Brien only contends with this when he nearly flees to Canada.

The “casement” that reveals O’Brien’s own nature to himself is when he meets and lives with Elroy Berdahl for several days at the Canadian border. Unlike most people at the time, Elroy “never prided” or put O’Brien “in a position that required lies or denials.” Elroy never forced some truth down O’Brien’s throat, like his local “PTA or church” would, nor did Elroy compel O’Brien to choose a truth. Instead, Elroy’s inaction silent compassion served as a window. While O’Brien’s “conscience told [him] to run…some irrational and powerful force was resisting, like a weight pushing [him] toward the war.” And through this episode, O’Brien makes an epiphany: “what it came down to, stupidly, was a sense of shame.” Ultimately, shame compelled O’Brien’s mindless acquiescence to go to Vietnam without resistance, and the same could be said of many other soldiers. The window of O’Brien’s seclusion from society illuminates one of the causes of the war, which is the pride that comes from one’s unerring view that one’s beliefs are the absolute truth. The victims of this flawed sense of self-righteousness are the countless deaths and the destruction of humanity of soldiers, but the soldiers who like O’Brien relinquish their “conscience” are not relieved from being perpetrators. O’Brien’s story allows him to take responsibility and confront his own complicity in the war.
